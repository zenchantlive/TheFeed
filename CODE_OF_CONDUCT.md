## Reporting and enforcement

If you experience or witness a violation, contact the maintainers at **zenchantlive@gmail.com** or alert a maintainer privately. Reports are handled confidentially. Maintainers may take actions proportionate to the impact, including warnings, content removal, or removal from the community. Repeat or severe violations may result in a project ban.
