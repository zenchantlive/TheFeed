# Notes for the next agent
- Mobile landing hero is now optimized for single-screen viewing on small devices; keep CTA copy concise to preserve height.
- Stats pill and secondary links are intentionally hidden on extra-small screens; only reintroduce if the first viewport still fits.
- Wireframe and intent are documented at the top of `src/components/home/landing-page.tsx` using line-by-line comments.
